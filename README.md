# Installation

- In your Chrome browser, navigate to your extension management page.
  - In Google Chrome, this would be [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
- If not enabled, enable the 'Developer mode' toggle in the top right corner of the page
- Click 'Load unpacked' in the top left corner.
- Navigate to your release of Curio or the `/frontent/` directory, if you cloned the repository, and click 'Select Folder' to finish installation
  - **[ [ NOTE ] ]** This should be the directory with a file called `manifest.json`

# Usage
At the moment, Curio employs a universal username and password for login which is required for the application to function properly:

- Username: admin
- Password: admin123

Once sign-in is complete, you will have access to powerful generative AI at the click of a button!

To use Curio, simply use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+shift+Y` to toggle website element selection; the same keyboard shortcut may be used to disable the macro.

Once element selection is activated, you will notice your mouse cursor highlighting the website elements.

When you have found one that you would like some more insight on, simple left click and Curio will automatically expand on the highlighted text block.
